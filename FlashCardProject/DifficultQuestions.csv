Why is compiling course code into byte code better than directly into machine code?# It is because you only need to write one source code and compiled it into byte code, any machine with JVM can use that byte code for particular operating system.
What happens to the curret stack frame whe a method is entered?# Every time a method is entered, a new stack frame is created on the top of the stack.
What happens to the current stack frame when a method is exited?# The current stack frame is destroyed.
What happens to the local variales when the stack frame is destroyed?# The local variables that were stored in the stack frame are also destroyed.
When a program is running what local variables can JVM see?# JVM can only see the local variablesin the current stack frame.
What is an abstract class?# An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract, it may or may not include abstract methods, and it can not be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
What can polymorphism do?# polymorphism refers to the ability of a class to prvide different implementations of a method, depending on the type of object that is passed to the method. In short, it allows us to perform the same cation in many different ways.
Why is try catch important to include?# By adding try catch block, java can deal with the exceptons that can happen in your code, like display an error message.
Why is read file a good way to retrieve text data?# Because it is not easy to write a huge amound text data inside an IDE, but it is easy to write them in a text edior, that can save us a lot of time and make our code cleaner.
Why is making our code loose coupling important?# Because loose coupled code in a class won't impact other class significantly.
